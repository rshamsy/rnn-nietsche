### rnn-nietsche

This is my attempt at creating an LSTM RNN using the fastai library. Throughout the fast.ai MOOC, I have tried to undertake the following learning cycle:
1. Watch video and take notes
2. Read blog posts and take notes/create diagrams to further strengthen knowledge of concepts noted from video
3. Attempt to build model being learned from scratch. 

The purpose of this repo is to showcase any code that I write for part 3 of my learning cycle for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

Running this code will require you to set up the fastai environment on your system, the instructions for which can be found in the following link: https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/README.md
